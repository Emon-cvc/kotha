					<p>CodersTrust is the brainchild of Ferdinand Kjærulff. As a Captain of the Danish army he served as recovery officer in Iraq after the fall of Saddam. He pioneered a recovery project with the allied forces, bringing internet and e-learning to the citizens of the region in which he was stationed. The project was a massive success and inspired him to eventually create CodersTrust – supported by Danida – with a vision to democratize access to education via the internet on a global scale</p>
					<p>CodersTrust helps young talented programmers in developing countries become a part of the labor market of the future. CodersTrust redefines the concept of virtual education and tie young peoples online education directly to the demand on the global online job markets. CodersTrust democratises education by creating a new education infrastructure, where the best IT- and software developers get in direct contact with employers all around the world.</p>	

					<p>CodersTrust’s mission is to upgrade technological labor in emergent markets and strive to make individuals with limited means become a part of the global technological jobrevolution. Millions of IT jobs are offered on a daily basis on jobsites, but youth in developing countries need qualifications in order to solve the tasks.</p>

					</ul>
					<p>CodersTrust engages the best programmers, provide them with a microloan so they can help their families while they work and achieve the qualifications needed to obtain even more clients – and one day maybe even become an entrepreneur.</p>

					<p>The present business model involves Coders Trust taking a 5% fee for administrative costs and study aid, and a 25% commission for earnings made during the period of the study course. Kjærulff says the idea for Coders Trust came about in 2005 during his time as a rebuilding officer in Iraq, where he was responsible for ICT training programs for public employees</p>
